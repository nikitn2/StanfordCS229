\item \points{15} {\bf Logistic Regression: Training stability}

In this problem, we will be delving deeper into the workings of logistic
regression. The goal of this problem is to help you develop your skills
debugging machine learning algorithms (which can be very different from
debugging software in general).

We have provided an implementation of logistic regression in
\texttt{src/stability/stability.py}, and two labeled datasets $A$ and $B$ in
\texttt{src/stability/ds1\_a.csv} and \texttt{src/stability/ds1\_b.csv}.

Please do not modify the code for the logistic regression training algorithm
for this problem. First, run the given logistic regression code to train two
different models on $A$ and $B$. You can run the code by simply executing
\texttt{python stability.py} in the \texttt{src/stability} directory.
